Scenario:
  The IT department at MYU is considering a new student portal. I was asked to analyze the issues that exist within the UI and task analysis.
  Additionally, I have been asked to create a digital prototype that addresses said issues within the task analysis.

Directions:
  Create a two to three page report. I had to identify user issues within the task analysis. Provide written recommendations informed by user-centered design. I had to create three user personas. These personas represent info regarding user needs.
  Additionally, I had to create a digital prototype that resolves issues found in the task analysis. With the papaer prototype, I had to conduct an observation of someone using it.
